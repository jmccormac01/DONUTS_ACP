Installed miniconda3-latest (python3)
Installed Github Desktop
Installed mysql

Q: add python3 in C:\ProgramData to PATH (struggling with french)
or use the anaconda prompt?

Installing astropy on windows was missing c1.exe. This appears to 
come from the VS C++ build tools. There was a conda specific note on astropy docs about installing
with conda rather than pip. Conda seems to work fine

Steps so far on windows with miniconda3:
conda install numpy
conda install scipy
conda install astropy
conda install scikit-image
conda install pymysql
pip install donuts (or install from source)

To do:
Add python3.6 to travis yaml file for testing with new python release

Set up a new table for the autoguider reference images with the following schema

CREATE TABLE autoguider_ref (
  field varchar(100) not null primary key,
  telescope varchar(20) not null,
  ref_image varchar(100) not null,
  filter varchar(20) not null,
  valid_from datetime not null,
  valid_until datetime
);

This table combines the NGTS style reference table and history table into one. Looking for any image 
with a valid_until == NULL gets the current reference image.

I then took previous good images from 20180215 for Sp0746+2000 and Sp1507-2000 and used them as 
references going forward. I will now update the code to look for and create reference images
if they do not exists

Installed mysql using community installer. Used a custom install with only Server, Workbench, utils and shell. 
The user name is "speculoos"
The password is "spec_ops"
The root password is the same as the login password for Io control machine
I created an operations database called spec_ops
I created a table in there called autoguider_log with the following schema. 

CREATE TABLE autoguider_log (
   updated timestamp default current_timestamp on update current_timestamp,
   reference varchar(50) not null,
   check varchar(50) not null,
   solution_x double not null,
   solution_y double not null,
   culled_max_shift_x varchar(5) not null,
   culled_max_shift_y varchar(5) not null,
   pid_x double not null,
   pid_y double not null,
   std_buff_x double not null,
   std_buff_y double not null   
);

To access the database manually fire up the mysql shell. Turn it to SQL mode with \sql.
Then connect to the server with \c localhost. Enter user the password above. Then navigate 
the db as normal with typical SQL syntax.

Look through logs in detail tomorrow. Looked tonight and spotted one wild measurement with pair Sp0828-1309-S001-R001-C001-I+z.fts	Sp0828-1309-S001-R001-C031-I+z.fts
Check why did this happen and why was it not culled? Culled set to n for this measurement for some reason. 
Next measurement was fine so the PID probably took it out but it should be cukled for sure. 

RMS in x [!outlier] = 0.5 pix, y =0.3 pix, which is not too bad given the lack of optimisation. 

Look at how to handle outliers after long runs of goog guiding. See around image 344.
